Basic GET commands

    - Copy JSON into something
    - with a route
    - Create


- Goes off to create it, (write to disk and returns a 201 when its done...)

Can we use this for GraphQL too?


Feature Ideas:

- move over to hooks and refactor and test the components
- add route
- remove route
- test expreess
 - Integration with dummy data (json-schema-faker)
 - .env integartion with node (tokens in here)

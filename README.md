# The problem

When building applications you often need to interact with services. When the services are not ready to be consumed you have a few options:

1. Mock out the response with a JSON file
2. Create a mock service yourself
3. Use MockIt.

# This solution

This tool was designed to help developers quickly create end points for their applications. No need to create a server, just use docker and run this project locally. You can create, edit and manage routes to your API. Every change to the API will be reflected on the server and updated straight away.

This tool comes with a few features out the box:

- CORS
- Basic Authentictaion
- Chaos Monkey (Unleash a monkey to take down your end points)

More information about how it works, its features can be found on the docs.
